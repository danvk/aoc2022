Blueprint 1:
  Each ore robot costs 4 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 2 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian.

Blueprint 2:
  Each ore robot costs 2 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 3 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 8 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 3 ore and 12 obsidian.

bp1:
- geode requires 2 ore + 7 obsidian
- geode requires 2 ore + 7 * (3 ore + 14 clay)
- geode requires (2 + 21) ore + 98 clay
- geode requires 2 + 21 + 164 ore

What's the most geodes you could produce from this?
{
  time: 19,
  robots: { ore: 1, clay: 9, obsidian: 0, geode: 0 },
  resources: { ore: 1, clay: 72, obsidian: 0, geode: 0 }
}

- In the example, you build an obsidian robot and then go back to building a clay robot.
  But what if you didn't do this? i.e. never backtrack to a lower class robot?
  This might give a more realistic lower bound.
