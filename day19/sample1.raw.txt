Blueprint 1:
  Each ore robot costs 4 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 2 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian.

Blueprint 2:
  Each ore robot costs 2 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 3 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 8 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 3 ore and 12 obsidian.

bp1:
- geode requires 2 ore + 7 obsidian
- geode requires 2 ore + 7 * (3 ore + 14 clay)
- geode requires (2 + 21) ore + 98 clay
- geode requires 2 + 21 + 164 ore

What's the most geodes you could produce from this?
{
  time: 19,
  robots: { ore: 1, clay: 9, obsidian: 0, geode: 0 },
  resources: { ore: 1, clay: 72, obsidian: 0, geode: 0 }
}

- In the example, you build an obsidian robot and then go back to building a clay robot.
  But what if you didn't do this? i.e. never backtrack to a lower class robot?
  This might give a more realistic lower bound.

Input:
Blueprint 1:
  Each ore robot costs 2 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 4 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 4 ore and 15 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 20 obsidian.

- We tend to only ever produce geode robots in the last few minutes.

Blueprint 28:
- Each ore robot costs 4 ore.
- Each clay robot costs 4 ore.
- Each obsidian robot costs 4 ore and 17 clay.
- Each geode robot costs 4 ore and 20 obsidian.

Don't get any geodes because 20 obsidian is just too high.
{
  time: 22,
  robots: { ore: 3, clay: 7, obsidian: 2, geode: 0 },
  resources: { ore: 9, clay: 21, obsidian: 7, geode: 0 }
}
t= 23 num states= 3706600
{
  time: 23,
  robots: { ore: 3, clay: 8, obsidian: 2, geode: 0 },
  resources: { ore: 8, clay: 29, obsidian: 9, geode: 0 }
}
t= 24 num states= 3340146
{
  time: 24,
  robots: { ore: 4, clay: 10, obsidian: 3, geode: 0 },
  resources: { ore: 8, clay: 29, obsidian: 12, geode: 0 }
}

Only hit the cap at t=20.
Can you prune paths that will never produce a geode at that point?

- If you have enough to produce a geode robot now (t=20), you get a geode at t=21

- t=21 Produce obsidian robot
- t=22 Produce one extra obsidian, what you build here is irrelevant
- t=23 need to build a geode robot NOW
- t=24 produce a geode

So at t=21, you can have at most
(resources.obsidian + 2*robots.obsidian + 1) obsidian at t=23
